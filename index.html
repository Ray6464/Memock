# Memock
A NodeJS library for developing mock servers to aid in development tools like APIs without access to seperate severs. It will allow you to develop and initiate a server that serves predetermined files and JSON objects over predetermined nodes, all with a few lines of JavaScript code.

# Installation
Use the following command to install MeMock as a development-tool:
```
npm i memock --save-dev
```
# Usage
To start the server, with all the default settings:
```
const memock = require('memock');

memock.init(); // starts the server
```

To configure the server add the configuration code before starting the server:
```javascript
const memock = require('memock');

memock.usePort(4000); // change the default port

memock.mainPageJSON({
  name: "my-netowkr",
  version: "1.5.3"
}); // change the default json displayed at the home page

memock.setServerDelay(5000); // change the latency in the server to mimic download times, here its 5 seconds

memock.init(); // starts the server
```

To add files at the server:
```javascript
const memock = require('memock');

memock.setFilesDirectory(path.join(__dirname, "/servedFiles")); // path should be absolute
memock.addFile("myVideo.mp4"); // displayed at /file1

memock.init(); // starts the server
```
